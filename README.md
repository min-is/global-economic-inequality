## Project Overview
A comprehensive analysis of global economic inequality using multimodal data visualization and analysis techniques. The project integrates GDP, income distribution, and human development indices to provide insights into global socioeconomic disparities.


### Components:
- SQL-based ETL pipelines for data integration
- Python data processing modules for transformation and analysis
- Interactive visualizations using Plotly and Matplotlib

## Background
Economic inequality remains one of the most pressing challenges in global development. While global GDP has increased significantly over recent decades, the distribution of this growth has been uneven across countries. This project aims to quantify these disparities and identify patterns and potential interventions.

## Real-World Impact
The insights from this analysis can inform:
- Policy decisions on international development
- Resource allocation for poverty reduction programs
- Identification of regions needing targeted interventions
- Understanding the relationship between economic growth and human development
